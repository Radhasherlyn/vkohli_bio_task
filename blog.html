    Eating habits
    In 2018, Kohli disclosed that he had made the decision to adopt a vegetarian diet 
    in an effort to alleviate the symptoms of a cervical spine issue caused by elevated levels of uric acid.
     This condition was impacting his finger movements, thus, affecting his performance as a batsman. 
     He made a conscious effort to abstain from consuming meat, as part of his regimen for maintaining optimal health.[342]
